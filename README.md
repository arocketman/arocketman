### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a **software engineer** specializing in designing architectures and writing software to deploy **highly available and scalable ML/AI services**.

Currently working at Spotify, previously employed at Vodafone and Unicredit bank.

I love contributing to open source projects, eat delicious food, drink good wine and watch memorable movies.
